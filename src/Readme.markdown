## Overview

You should start all new Corona Native projects by copying this project.

This project allows you to:

* develop cross-platform Corona Native apps
* create native plugins for Corona

## Code Walkthrough

### iOS and tvOS

Both `ios` and `tvos` folders contain projects `Plugin` and `App`. `App` contains sample Corona Native app with linked Corona Plugin inside `Plugin` project. Plugin is called `'plugin.library'`. `App` projects contain implementation of the `CoronaDelegate` protocol. In particular it has the method `willLoadMain:` which is your opportunity to modify the Lua state prior to execution of `main.lua`.

Hitting ▶ to run a the `App` project with Xcode would run project with Lua code inside `Corona` folder.

Note that Corona uses config files to specify various options required for Corona plugins and apps to be built.

### macOS

Folders contain sample plugin for macOS Simulator and Desktop app. Note that plugin is a combination of compiled Lua and C++ code. To debug it, you can set up Executable: press "Edit Scheme" (`⌘<`), and select `Corona Simulator.app` from Applications folder.

* custom build phase would copy plugin so it can be tested in Corona Simulator
* custom build rule compiles Lua files in project so they can be used in C/C++

### Windows

Folders contain sample plugin for Windows Simulator and Desktop app. Note that plugin is a combination of compiled Lua and C++ code. Review project properties to change plugin name or location of Corona Simulator.

Open `Plugin.sln` and run it. This should build a sample plugin, copy it to Corona plugin folder, start Corona Simulator.

### Android

* Drag and drop `android` folder on Android Studio dock icon or select "Open an existing Android Studio project" to open and run project. If you're getting continuous errors try to clean the project (entry in Build menu) and build it again.
* Run Gradle target `setUpCoronaAppAndPlugins` to download plugins and set up AndroidManifest.xml. This would almost copy Simulator build process except several arguments which come from build app dialog
* To enable Play Store Asset Delivery uncomment line in `gradle.properties`. After that make sure to use `bundle` instead of assemble, since apk would not contain actual assets. To run app from the Android Studio in configurations drop-down click "Edit Configurations..." and select "APK from app bundle" instead of "Default APK" for the "app" configuration.
* The Android "Application" class is overridden in this application so that a CoronaRuntimeListener can be set up before a Corona activity has been displayed.  This listener detects when a Corona runtime has been loaded, started, suspended, resumed, and exiting.  The listener's onLoaded() method is the application's opportunity to add its own custom Lua API to the Corona project.  See source file "CoronaApplication.java" on how to implement this.
* Lua functions are implemented in Java by using the "com.naef.jnlua.NamedJavaFunction" interface.  All source files ending with "*LuaFunction.java" in this sample project implement this interface.  They demonstrate how to use a LuaState object to perform fundamental operations such as fetching argument values, returning values, working with tables/arrays, and calling Lua functions from Java.
* Source file "AsyncCallLuaFunction.java" demonstrates how to safely call a Lua function from another thread.  This is important if you want to set up an asynchronous Lua function that accepts a Lua callback to be called from another thread once the asynchronous operation has ended.
